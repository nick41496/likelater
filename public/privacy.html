      <h1>Privacy policy</h1>
      <p><i>Last updated: July 23, 2020</i></p>

      <p>
        Likelater policies are open source, licensed under
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0</a>. Adapted from the
        <a href="https://github.com/basecamp/policies">Basecamp open-source policies</a> /

      </p>

      <p>
        The privacy of your data (and it is your data, not ours!) is a big deal to us. In this
        policy, we lay out: what data we collect and why; how your data is handled; and your rights
        to your data. We promise we never sell your data: never have, never will.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect and why</h2>

      <p>
        Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here's what that means in practice:
      </p>

      <h3>Identity & access</h3>

      <p>
        When you sign up for Likelater, we gather identifying information such as your Twitter
        handle and email address from your linked Twitter account. This is to enable the services
        that we provide. We'll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won't use your
        information in marketing statements without your permission either.
      </p>

      <h3>Tweets</h3>

      <p>
        We collect tweets that you have liked on your linked Twitter account in order to enable the
        services that we provide. This includes liked tweets from private accounts. We do not access
        your information for purposes other than providing you the service and providing you
        support, with your consent.
      </p>

      <h3>Cookies and Do Not Track</h3>

      <p>
        We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences and make it easier for
        you to use our applications. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it
        remember your login information, site preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention
        settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which
        cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit:
        www.allaboutcookies.org.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this time, Likelater does not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browsers or browser
        plugins, as we do not currently track usage.
      </p>

      <h3>Voluntary correspondence</h3>

      <p>
        When you write Likelater with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence,
        including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference
        if you reach out in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer
        interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference
        or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.
      </p>

      <p>Information we do not collect</p>


      <p>
        We don't collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race,
        gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and
        mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you
        include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also do not collect any biometric data.
      </p>

      <h2>When we access or share your information</h2>

      <p>
        Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we'll ever access or
        share your info are:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>To provide products or services you've requested</b>. We do use some third-party services
        to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your
        personal information via these third parties. These are listed below.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/company/privacy/">Heroku</a>. Cloud services
          provider.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission</b>. If at any
        point we need to access your account to help you with a Support case, we will ask for your
        consent before proceeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses</b>. Accessing a
        customer's account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have
        an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people
        reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the
        process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will
        report the incident to the appropriate authorities.
      </p>

      <p><b>When required under applicable law.</b></p>

      <p>All of Likelater's data infrastructure are located in the US.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If US law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court
          order requiring we share data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we flat-out reject requests
          from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data. And unless we're legally
          prevented from it, we'll always inform you when such requests are made. In the event a
          government authority outside the US approaches Likelater with a request, our default
          stance is to refuse unless the US government compels us to comply through procedures
          outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. We have never received a
          National Security Letter or Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) order.
        </li>

        <li>
          Similarly, If Likelater receives a request to preserve data, we refuse unless compelled by
          either the US Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f) or a properly
          served US subpoena for civil matters. In both of these situations, we have to comply. In
          these situations, we notify affected customers as soon as possible unless we are legally
          prohibited from doing so. We do not share preserved data unless absolutely required under
          the Stored Communications Act or compelled by a court order that we choose not to appeal.
          Furthermore, unless we receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the
          required preservation period expires, we destroy any preserved copies we made of customer
          data once the preservation period lapses.
        </li>

        <li>
          If we get an informal request from any person, organization, or entity, we do not assist.
          If you are an account owner who wants to export data from their accounts, you can do so by
          emailing <a href="mailto:info@likelater.io">info@likelater.io</a> from the email address
          on your account.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Finally, if Likelater is acquired by a company (we don't plan on that, but if it happens)
        we'll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a
        different privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2>Location of Site and Data</h2>

      <p>
        Likelater is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union or
        elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide
        to us will be transferred to the United States. By using our Site, participating in any of
        our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights With Respect to Your Information</h2>

      <p>
        At Likelater, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their
        location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European
        Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") and California Consumer Privacy Act
        ("CCPA") in the US. Likelater recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations,
        except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Right to Know</b>. You have the right to know what personal information is collected,
          used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we
          collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right of Access</b>. This includes your right to access the personal information we
          gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage,
          security and processing of that information.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right to Correction</b>. You have the right to request correction of your personal
          information.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right to Erasure / "To be Forgotten"</b>. This is your right to request, subject to
          certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from
          our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data
          deletion requests may prevent you from using Likelater services because our applications
          may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing
          your account.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right to Complain</b>. You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling
          of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify
          your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to
          <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">
            https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en
          </a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right to Restrict Processing</b>. This is your right to request restriction of how
          and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of
          personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data).
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right to Object</b>. You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or
          why your personal information is processed.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right to Portability</b>. You have the right to receive the personal information we
          have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making</b>. You have the right to
          object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant,
          effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is
          limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between
          you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Right to Non-Discrimination</b>. This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will
          not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or
          give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy
          rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”)
          may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account
        information.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us
        at <a href="mailto:info@likelater.io">info@likelater.io</a>. For requests to delete
        personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first
        verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already
        collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on
        your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder
        before proceeding.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find
        out more about GDPR, at <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">

        </a>.
      </p>

      <h2>How we secure your data</h2>

      <p>
        All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The
        database backups are also encrypted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to
        send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.
      </p>

      <h2>When you request to delete your data</h2>

      <p>
        You may, at any time, request to delete the data stored in Likelater's systems by emailing
        <a href="mailto:info@likelater.io">info@likelater.io</a>. After confirming with you that
        you would like your data irretrievably deleted, we will purge your data and personal
        information from our systems.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes & questions</h2>

      <p>
        We may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any
        new practices. You can view a history of the changes to our policies on GitHub. We will
        announce significant changes to our policies via email.
      </p>
