      <h1>Terms of service</h1>

      </p>

      <p>
        Because we don't know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some
        Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say "Likelater", "we", "our", or "us" in this document, we are referring to
        Likelater, the software project owned and operated by Nick White.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say "the operator", we are referring to Nick White, owner and operator of Likelater.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we say "Services", we mean the Likelater product and related services, whether
        delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.
      </p>

      <p>
        We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all changes made since
        on GitHub. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also email an
        announcement of these changes to users who have not opted out.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of
        Service. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of
        the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. These terms
        do contain a limitation of our liability.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you violate of any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement
        and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by
        being open about who we are, how we work, and keeping an open door to
        <a href="mailto:info@likelater.io">your feedback</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Account Terms</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Likelater
          cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this
          security obligation.
        </li>

        <li>
          You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our Use Restrictions policy.
        </li>

        <li>
          You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your account. That includes
          content posted by others who have access to your login credentials.
        </li>

        <li>
          You must be a human. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not
          permitted.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Cancellation and Termination</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. You can cancel your
          account by contacting us from the email address associated with your account at
          <a href="mailto:info@likelater.io">info@likelater.io</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          All of your content will be inaccessible and deleted from the Services immediately upon
          cancellation. We cannot recover this information once it has been deleted. If you want to
          export any data before your account is cancelled, please include that in your request to
          cancel, or in another correspondence prior to the one requesting to cancel your account.
        </li>

        <li>
          We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or
          future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you will not be
          able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore
          result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture
          and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the
          use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time.
        </li>

        <li>
          Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of
          operator will result in immediate account termination.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Modifications to the Service and Prices</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          If we decide to suspend the maintenance of the product, we will provide ample notice and
          opportunity for users to export their data. We reserve the right at any time to modify or
          discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Service with or without notice.
        </li>

        <li>
          We may begin to charge for services in the future. If we do so, we will exempt existing
          users from payment for the services available to them at the time they signed up.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Uptime, Security, and Privacy</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an "as is" and
          "as available" basis. We do not offer service-level agreements for most of our Services but
          do take uptime of our applications seriously. Visit
          <a href="https://twitter.com/likelater">https://twitter.com/likelater</a> to see the status
          of our Service.
        </li>

        <li>
          We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds
          the average usage of other customers of the Service. Of course, we'll reach out to the
          account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may
          negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.
        </li>

        <li>
          We take appropriate measures to secure your data. To report security issues, please open a
          <a href="https://github.com/nickpwhite/likelater/issues/new/choose">GitHub issue</a> or
          contact us at <a href="mailto:info@likelater.io">info@likelater.io</a>. We will take action
          to remedy security issues discovered by us or brought to our attention.
        </li>

        <li>
          When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You
          agree that Likelater may process your data as described in our Privacy Policy and for no
          other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:

          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>To help you with support requests you make</b>. We'll ask for express consent
              before accessing your account.
            </li>

            <li>
              <b>To safeguard Likelater</b>. We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to
              ensure the security of your data and the Service as a whole. If necessary, we may also
              access accounts as part of an abuse report investigation.
            </li>

            <li>
              To the extent required by applicable law. As a US entity with all data infrastructure
              located in the US, we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US
              government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored
              Communications Act. If a non-US authority approaches Likelater for assistance, our
              default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government,
              which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal
              assistance treaty or agreement mechanism.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware,
          software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service. You
          can see a list of all subprocessors who handle personal data in our
          <a href="/privacy">Privacy policy</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), Likelater is a "service provider", not
          a "business" or "third party", with respect to your use of the Service. That means we
          process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described
          in these Terms of Service, Privacy policy, and other policies. We do not retain, use,
          disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have
          your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements
          under the CCPA and not use Likelater's Service in a way that violates the regulations.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Copyright and Content Ownership</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. All
          materials uploaded remain yours.
        </li>

        <li>
          The names, look, and feel of the Service are copyrightÂ© to the operator. All rights
          reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          or visual design elements without express written permission from the operator. You must
          request permission to use the Service logo for promotional purposes. Please
          <a href="mailto:info@likelater.io">email us</a> requests to use logos. We reserve the
          right to rescind this permission if you violate these Terms of Service.
        </li>

        <li>
          You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the
          Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without the express written
          permission of the operator.
        </li>

        <li>
          You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the
          Service or the operator.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Features and Bugs</h2>

      <ol>
        <li>
          We design our Service with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of users
          who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that
          pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Service will meet your specific
          requirements or expectations.
        </li>

        <li>
          We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software,
          our Service inevitably has some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through
          priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will
          get fixed and we don't guarantee a completely error-free Service.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Liability</h2>

      <p>
        We mention liability throughout these Terms but to put it all in one section:
      </p>

      <p>
        <b><i>
            You expressly understand and agree that the operator shall not be liable, in law or in
            equity, to you or to any third party for any direct, indirect, incidental, lost profits,
            special, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to,
            damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if the
            operator has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from: (i) the
            use or the inability to use the Services; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute
            goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or
            obtained or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the Services;
            (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv)
            statements or conduct of any third party on the service; (v) or any other matter
            relating to this Terms of Service or the Services, whether as a breach of contract, tort
            (including negligence whether active or passive), or any other theory of liability.
        </b></i>
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words: choosing to use our Services does mean you are making a bet on us. If the
        bet does not work out, that's on you, not us. We do our darnedest to be as safe a bet as
        possible through careful management of the business; investments in security,
        infrastructure, and talent; and in general giving a damn. If you choose to use our Services,
        thank you for betting on us.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have a question about any of the Terms of Service, please
        <a href="mailto:info@likelater.io">contact our Support team</a>.
